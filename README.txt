Simple parallel-beam computed tomography simulator (implemented both in MATLAB and CUDA)—Can both create a sinogram (radon transform) for a given image and reconstruct the original image using filtered backprojection. The implementation of each step is very simple and done WITHOUT the use of RADON or IRADON in MATLAB. The goal of this code is to make it easier to understand basic computed tomography. Furthermore, our CUDA-based implementations exploits various opportunities to parallelize computation, perform texture-based interpolation instead of CPU-based interpolation to make each step (sinogram creation/radon transform, ramp filtering—using cuFFT library, and backprojection) proceed much more quickly.
